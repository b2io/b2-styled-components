# b2-styled-components
Not much to this right now. More or less a playground for us to try out some styles in JavaScript. We are building React components using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs) to implement our styles.

# Getting started
```
npm install
npm start
```

# Linting
```
npm run lint:css
```

**Note**: The linter currently always errors out. There are also a few linter settings that the linter is not yet evaluating correctly for styled-components (related to alpha-ordering and empty lines).

# Syntax Highlighting
Follow the [styled-components instructions](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components#syntax-highlighting) for adding proper syntax highlighting to your IDE.

# Working in other browsers (besides Chrome)
To debug outside of Chrome, you'll need the react-devtools installed globally. Then run `react-devtools` from your terminal while the development environment is running. Works in other browsers as well as most emulators and simulators.

# Additional documentation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
