# b2-styled-components
Not much to this right now. More or less a playground for us to try out some styles in javascript. We are building React components using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs) to implement our styles.

# Working in other browsers (besides chrome)
To debug outside of chrome, you'll need the react-devtools installed globally. Then run `react-devtools` from your terminal while the development environment is running. Works in other browsers as well as most emulators and simulators.

# Additional documentation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
